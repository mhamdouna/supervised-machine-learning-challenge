## Week 19 Challenge
----------------------------

*Below are the steps taken to solve the challenge:*

* Import relevant libraries.
* Import CSV file.
* Set X and y values by selecting relevant data from file.
* Split the data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test.

For LogisticRegression:
* Import ###LogisticRegression Library from sklearn.
* Set up an classifier instance, and fit it to the X_train and y_train values.
* Find model score. 

For Random Forest Classifer:
* Import ###StandardScaler Library from sklearn to scale all parameters.
* Set up an scaler instance, and fit it to the X_train values, then transform it with the X_test values.
* Import ###RandomForestClassifier Library from sklearn.
* Set up an instance, and find the score for both the training and testing data.
